In order to run this project locally, you'll need to create am .env.local on the root of the project with the corresponding RapidAPI key.
It also needs to be subscribed to the "movies-tv-shows-database" service.

```
RAPIDAPI_KEY="YOUR API KEY";
```

Testing and coverage:

- [x] Tested the cartSlice to check that the reducers and selectors correctly impact and reflect the state in redux.
